# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting house prices using a real-world dataset sourced from Kaggle.  
Multiple machine learning models were implemented and compared to identify the most accurate approach.

---

## 📌 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Type:** Tabular housing data
- **Target Variable:** House Price

## 🧠 Models Implemented
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Lasso Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

## 📊 Model Performance Summary
Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated using metrics such as **R² Score**, **MSE**

### 🔹 Best Performing Model
- **Decision Tree Regressor** achieved the highest performance among all tested models.
- It captured non-linear relationships in the housing data effectively.
- Provided more accurate predictions compared to linear and ensemble models for this dataset.

### 🔹 Other Observations
- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting produced competitive results but did not outperform the Decision Tree.
- Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso were used as baseline models.

📌 **Final Conclusion:**  
The **Decision Tree Regressor** was selected as the final model due to its superior performance on the test dataset.
